=========================================================

It will cover all the latest features introduced in java8

## 1. Default Methood in Interface
  ### Default and Static methods in Java8
  Java 8 introduces a new concept of default and static method implementation in interfaces. Before Java 8, interfaces could have only abstract methods but now It allows the interfaces to have methods with implementation without affecting the classes that implement the interface and provides backward comparability so that existing interfaces can use the lambda expressions without implementing the methods in the implementation class. More details can be found on my blog over [here](http://www.waheedtechblog.com/2017/04/default-and-static-methods-in-java8.html) and you can download the source code from [here](https://github.com/abdulwaheed18/java8/tree/master/src/com/waheedtechblog/defaultinterface)
